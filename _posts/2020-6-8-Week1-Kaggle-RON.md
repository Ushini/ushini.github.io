Your task is to design an unconventional clock. You have complete freedom to interpret "unconventional clock" however you'd like. The only requirement is that your design must change over time somehow. The code template I have provided already stores the second() value of the clock in the sec variable, the minute() value of the clock in the min variable and the hour() value of the clock in the hr variable.

It's ok if everything doesn't work perfectly
It's ok if you don't finish implementing your idea
It's ok if you planned to make a clock which changes over time, but didn't have time to animate your sketch
If you finish before the 25 minutes are up, that's all good.
You can ask me if you have any questions during the process. I will help you out to the best of my ability.
This is not a test and there's no need to impress. The more you can treat this like a relaxed lab or tutorial, the better :)
Activity E (25 min)
I have provided two sketches which contain some pre-written code; sketch1.js and sketch2.js. Your task is to select one of these sketches and make your modifications to it. You can make as many variations to the sketch as you'd like. You should aim to make at least one variation of the sketch which has been provided.

Your modifications can be as "big" or "small" as you'd like.
You are free to make any changes you'd like to the code.
If you finish making your variations before the 25 minutes have ended, that's all good.

#Project Outline

I have decided to start a Kaggle project for enjoyment, improvement of machine learning skills and general self development. This is probably the first large project I'll be doing which I will not be receiving a grade for. Yay self motivation. I hope by the end of this project (assuming I'll complete it... WHICH I WILL!) I will be more confident in starting my own ML projects. Actually, let me create a small checklist for myself.

- [ ] More confident to start personal projects
- [ ] Get a general lay-of-the-land of Kaggle
- [ ] actually complete a project
- [ ] either build something end-to-end i.e. deploy the model somewhere...
- [ ] ...(and) or thoroughly explore the process of analysing, refining and improving an ML model. 
- [ ] I mean, it'd be nice to place within the highly ranked teams (top 200)

The problem statement of the project is pretty straight forward: 
*"Given tweet data (tweet text, keyword, location), predict whether the tweet is about a real disaster or not"*

The model will be evaluated using the F1 measure. 

##Initial thoughts: 
Just very quickly, I think the first thing I want to try is an LSTM classifier. I'll just use the twitter text data for now.

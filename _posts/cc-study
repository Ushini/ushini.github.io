# CC Study Activities

## Activity P (25 min)

### Recreate the sketch below

Your first task is to recreate the sketch below. There are two videos below, showing two versions of the sketch. The second video shows you the final version. If it helps you, you can begin by implement what is shown in the first video.

- It's ok if everything doesn't work perfectly
- It's ok if you don't finish implementing the sketch
- It's ok if you planned to make a clock which changes over time, but didn't have time to animate your sketch
- If you finish before the 25 minutes are up, that's all good. You can take a break :)
- You can ask me if you have any questions during the process. I will help you out to the best of my ability.
- This is not a test and there's no need to impress. The more you can treat this like a relaxed lab or tutorial, the better :)


## Activity E (25 min)

You have been provided some code in your editor. Your task is to make as many variations to the sketch as you'd like. You should aim to make at least one variation of the sketch which has been provided. You should aim to make your visuals _"expressive"_ using colour, animation, interaction and/or any other technique. "Expressive" means to make someone feel an emotion.

- Your modifications can be as "big" or "small" as you'd like.
- You are free to make any changes you'd like to the code.
- If you finish making your variations before the 25 minutes have ended, that's all good. You can take another break :)
